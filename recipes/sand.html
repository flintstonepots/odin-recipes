    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Brioche marble bread sliced or in a loaf</li>
        <li>Ham of your choosing I prefer Honey Ham</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Provolone</li>
        <h4>Sauce</h4>
        <p> You do not have to include this sauce, the sandwhich is fantastic without it. Here is the one I reccomend.</p><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/white-sauce-or-bechamel-sauce-40046">Bechamel Sauce</a>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preperation</h4>
    <ol>
        <Li>If you are planning of making the sauce prepare that first by following the instructions on the link above.</Li>
        <li>Get two sautee pans out one large one small and one skillet. Set them on the stove on Medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Slice your bread or just put your pre sliced bread on your larger pan after coating with butter.</li>
        <li>Then spray your small pan with no stick spray and crack two eggs cook to your desired temp I prefer over medium for this sandwhich.</li>
        <li>Sear both side of your Ham in your skillet. Then add two slices of cheese and pour 2 tablespoons of water in your pan and cover with a lid. set temp to low and leave till cheese is fully melted.</li>
        <li>Take your toasted bread and cover with sauce if you chose to make it if not grab your eggs and ham and lay them on your bread.</li>
        <li>Take a big bite and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
